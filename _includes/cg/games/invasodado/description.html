In June of 2012, we set up an invite-only mixer for single retro games, kind of like a speed-dating thing. 
Most of the games invited were still getting over some rather nasty divorce or separation issues. 
It was a nice learning experience (Dear Lord, does Custer's Revenge have baggage), but it turned out 
to be something of a bust. For the most part. Space Invaders and Columns, as it turns out, were destined 
for each other. Fast forward to July 2013, and their first child is born. Much rejoicing and alcohol was had. 
The baby was hence christened "Invasodado." So all right, you've got the usual Earth defense routine, what 
with the space ship and the aliens and the danger. This particular breed, however, leaves behind a rather 
strange and inconvenient mess behind; upon death, they turn into colored blocks that must be matched in 
threes (or more) to clear! If you don't, the stage will overflow, you'll die, and we will forever look 
upon you in shame.
