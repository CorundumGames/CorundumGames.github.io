In early July 2012, we set up an invite-only mixer for single retro games, kind
of like a speed-dating thing.  Most of the games invited were still getting over
some rather nasty divorce or separation issues.  It was a nice learning
experience (Dear Lord, does Custer's Revenge have baggage), but it turned out to
be something of a bust.

For the most part.

Space Invaders and Columns, as it turns out, were destined for each other.  Fast
forward to June 2013, and their first child is born.  Much rejoicing and alcohol
was had.  The baby was christened "Invasodado," meaning "Cube Invader" in Spanish.

Put together the two halves that make this whole in a seamless alien-blasting,
color-matching, high-scoring arcade puzzle-shooter experience!
