    You know what's nice? Shapes. You know what else is nice? Things that glow. You know what's even nicer? Putting them together.

    Normally, we'd be regretful of our strict no-firearms-in-the-office policy. But in an effort to be cheeky and circumvent the rules, somebody brought their gravity beam from home, and
    <em>man is it cool.</em>
</p>

<p>Use the gravity beam to attract and repel your way to success in ten (currently planned) levels! Smash your foes into walls, hazards, and each other, and watch the vectors fly! Zip between asteroids and lure hordes of baddies to their doom with the silkiest, smoothest controls available this side of the Cartesian plane.</p>

    Show that geometry who's boss&emdash;they can't win the wars they start.

    <small>Gravv is currently in development. A free demo build containing two levels is available to play. The final product may or not differ from the demo in various ways, major or minor. Your feedback is greatly appreciated&emdash;it'll help us give you a really kickass game.</small>
