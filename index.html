<p>
    You are about to enter a world of pixellated bliss. Beyond this point lies a distractive force so potent, entire corporations have fallen as they vy to no avail to do their jobs despite being in the face of our handiwork.<sup>*</sup> Our craft is banned in most Western European countries except for weekends and holidays.<sup>*</sup> You are entering the realm of Corundum Games, the point of no return, the last stop before a future wrought with electronic hedonism, accidental procrastination, and pink slips of despair. But don't worry; we'll make it worth your while.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>We are the diamond in the rough.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Corundum Games is an independent game studio based near the New York metropolitan area, tended to and cared for by people who should be studying for statistics exams. Our goal is to make something that tickles your retro-gaming fancy, with a dash of humor here and there and some liberally applied fair use.

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : My Blog =)
    
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
